What's Your Number?
"A quick way to figure out the correct macronutrients you need to achieve your fitness goals."


Try it: yournumber.herokuapp.com


This is a fitness app built mostly with Angularjs, which allows
you to figure out your macronutrient ratio and numbers that you
need to be getting every day to achieve your fitness goal.


I am a Certified Personal Trainer and I used formulas such as the
Harris-Benedict Metabolic Rate equation to help figure out the
numbers. Nonetheless, this app is still in development so please know it is subject to bugs! If the numbers you are seeing don't make sense, especially if you have crunched numbers more than once per page reload, please reload the page to reset to normal behavior. Improvements are in progress.
